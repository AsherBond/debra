.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Debra is for building Debian packages.  The \fBcreate\fR subcommand creates a directory for building Debian packages.  The \fBDEBIAN/control\fR file is initialized from the first applicable source: the file named by the next command line argument, \fB$HOME/.debra\fR, or an empty template.
.
.P
It is left to the user to populate \fBDEBIAN/control\fR, \fBDEBIAN/postinst\fR, \fBDEBIAN/prerm\fR, and the fake filesystem presented by Debra.  \fBsourceinstall\fR(8) can assist in this process.  The \fBsourceinstall\fR subcommand calls \fBsourceinstall\fR(8) with all arguments passed by the user plus \fB\-d \fIname\fR\fR to set the \fBDESTDIR\fR argument to \fBmake install\fR automatically.
.
.P
When the package is ready, the \fBbuild\fR subcommand creates a Debian package with the specified filename.  \fBDEBIAN/md5sums\fR is automatically populated with the hashes of each file that will be part of the archive.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Debra can build a Debian package for itself.  This example shows how you can use \fBreprepro\fR(1) to publish the newly\-built Debian package to a local Debian archive and install it through \fBapt\-get\fR(8).
